/**
 * \brief A Scene to be ray traced.
 *
 * A Scene collects Object, LightSource, and Camera data together for rendering.
 * It also includes basic information about the environment (backgroundColour, ambientLight),
 * the image to be produced (renderWidth, renderHeight, filename), and the maximum number of 
 * reflections to allow (maxRayDepth). 
 *
 * Internally it provides the methods required to render an image, such as intersecting a Ray
 * with the Objects in the Scene, and computing the Colour from a Ray.
 *
 * Scene makes use of std::shared_ptr, which is a 'smart pointer' available in C++ since the 2011
 * revision. These provide a safer alternative to raw pointers, since deallocation is handled
 * automatically. You can treat them mostly like normal pointers though, so if you have a shared 
 * pointer to a Sphere, you can get its properties like this:
 * \code
 * // sphere_ptr is a std::shared_ptr<Sphere>
 * sphere_ptr->transform.rotateX(30);
 * \endcode
 *

	 * computations and comptues the observed Colour. For some Objects it may be necessary
	 * to cast other Rays to deal with reflections. This can conceivably recurse forever,

	 * If the Ray does not hit any Object, then the Scene's backgroundColour should be 
	 * returned.
	 *
	 * \todo Currently this method only deals with ambient lighting and Material properties.
	 *       It needs to be extended to account for the diffuse, specular, and mirror properties
	 *       of the Material of the Object that is hit. Recall from lectures that the formula for
	 *       a combination of ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting is
	 *       \f[ I = I_ak_a + \sum_j{I_j\left( k_d(\hat{\mathbf{\ell}}_j\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}) + k_s(\hat{\mathbf{e}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{r}}_j)^n \right)},\f]
	 *       where the sum is over the LightSources in the Scene.
	 *       You will also need to cast additional Rays to check for shadows and for reflections.
	 *       The number of recursions made for reflections should be limited by the 
	 *       rayDepth parameter passed to this method.
	 * 
	 * \param viewRay The Ray to intersect with the Objects in the Scene.
	 * \param rayDepth The maximum number of reflection Rays that can be cast.
	 * \return The Colour observed by the viewRay.
