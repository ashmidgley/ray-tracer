 * \brief Class to display and save images.
 *
 * The Display class [should provide] a simple method to make images, show them in
 * a window, and save them to a file. This version only writes binary PPM
 * files, and does not do any actual display functions. However, it doesn't
 * require OpenCV, so may be useful to people working outside of the lab environment.
 *
 * Note that Display is NonCopyable, so does not have a copy constructor or
 * assingment operator available. You can, however, create multiple displays..

	 * names, but this is not enforced. Two Display objects with the same window
	 * name will function correctly, and will store distinct images. It just won't 
	 * be possible to view them both at the same time.
