 * PinholeCamera implements a common Camera model that gives ideal perspective
 * projections. The camera is defined by a point (the camera centre) and an image 
 * plane at some distance along the Z-axis (the focal distance). The projection of
 * a 3D point into the image is the intersection of the line from the camera centre 
 * to the 3D point with the image plane.
