/**
 * \brief Class for Transform objects.
 *
 * A Transform is essentially a 4x4 matrix which is applied to a Vector represented 
 * in homogeneous form. How the Transform is applied, however, depends on what the
 * Vector represents. This is accounted for by having separate subclasses of Vector
 * for Point, Normal, and Direction representations. The Transform can then be applied
 * to any of these in the correct way. 
 *
 * A Transform is computed through a series of basic transformations, such as scaling
 * or translation. As these are applied, an inverse transformation matrix is also 
 * computed, by applying geometrical reasoning to generate matrix inverses.
