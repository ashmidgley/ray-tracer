/**
 * \brief Class defining Material colours and properties.
 *
 * The interaction between light and various sorts of material can be very complex.
 * In this ray tracer, we use a simplified model, which still has several components.
 * A Material for an object has a number of different Colour properties. The observed 
 * Colour of an object comes from the interaction of different types of light and different
 * Material properties:
 * - The ambientLight from the Scene and the Material's ambientColour combine to give a base Colour.
 * - Each light which can be seen from the surface provides a number of components:
 *   - A diffuse component, which follows a Lambertian illumination model and uses the Material's diffuseColour.
 *   - A specular component, which follows a Phong illumination model and uses the Material's specularColour and specularExponent.
 * - Some surfaces create mirror-reflections, which are influenced by the mirrorColour. For example, reflections in a gold surface should appear yellow.
 * Also, not all LightSource objects give white light, and the Colour of an object depends on the interaction between the light and surface colours.
