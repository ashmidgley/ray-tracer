	 *
	 * The intersection of a Ray with a Sphere comes down to a quadratic formula
	 * of the form \f$at^2 + bt + c\f$, where \f$t\f$ is the distance along the Ray, and
	 * \f$a\f$, \f$b\f$, and \f$c\f$ are some constants. The solutions for \f$t\f$ are given by
	 * \f[
	 *   \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
	 * \f]
	 * The number of intersections depends on the value of \f$b^2-4ac\f$. If it is negative
	 * then the Ray misses the Sphere and there are no intersections. A positive value indicates
	 * two intersection (entering and then leaving the Sphere). Finally, if \f$b^2-4ac = 0\f$ then
	 * there is a single grazing hit with the Sphere.
	 *
	 * \param ray The Ray to intersect with this Sphere.
	 * \return A list (std::vector) of intersections, which may be empty.
