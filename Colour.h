/**
 * \brief Class to store colour information.
 *
 * Colours are an important aspect of Material objects, and the 
 * basic quanitity that a ray tracer comptues for a ray. Colours
 * are represented as RGB triples, with values in the range [0,1].
 * Note that during computation, Colour values may go outside of the
 * range [0,1]. Because of this, these bounds are not enforced. However
 * Colours can be brought back into this range with the clip() method.
 *
 * Colour objects also have basic arithmetic operators defined on them.
 * These are applied independently to each component. This is an important
 * distinction from Vector and Matrix objects, which have particular rules
 * for arithmetic (particularly multiplication).
