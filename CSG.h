	 * indicate where the ray passes through the border of the
	 * object and flips between being inside or outside of that
	 * object. By sorting and then merging the lists of
	 * intersections from each of the two child objects, it can be
	 * determined which intersections represent an actual hitpoint
	 * on the overall CSG object.

	 * \return A list (std::vector) of intersections, which may be empty.
