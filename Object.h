/**
 * \brief Abstract base class for Objects.
 *
 * An Object is a geometric entity that can be seen in a camera, such as a Sphere or Cube.
 * The term 'Object' is commonly used, but creates a bit of tension with the 'object' in 
 * 'object-oriented programming'. For this documentation a 'big-O' Object is a thing that
 * can be seen by a camera, and a 'little-o' object is a data structure with members and
 * methods etc. Hopefully this will be clear from context anyway.
 *
 * Different types of Object are distinguished primarily by their intersect() functions,
 * which determine how a given Ray intersects the surface of the Object. An Object is 
 * usually created at the origin with some standard dimensions. They can then me moved,
 * rotated, and resized through their transform member.
 *
 * As an abstract base class, you cannot create a Camera directly.
 * Instead one of its concrete subclasses must be created.

	 *
	 * The details of this depend on the geometry of the particular Object, so this is a 
	 * pure virtual method.
