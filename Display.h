/**
 * \brief Class to display and save images.
 *
 * The Display class provides a simple method to make images, show them in
 * a window, and save them to a file. It is a wrapper around some OpenCV 
 * functions that provides an abstraction that gives just enough functionality
 * for the Ray Tracer.
 *
 * Note that Display is NonCopyable, so does not have a copy constructor or
 * assingment operator available. You can, however, create multiple displays..

	 *
	 * A Display is an image associated with a window where it can be shown.
	 * Multple displays can be created, and should normally have different window 
	 * names, but this is not enforced. Two Display objects with the same window
	 * name will function correctly, and will store distinct images. It just won't 
	 * be possible to view them both at the same time.
	 *
	 * \param windowName The (unique) name of the window for this Display.
	 * \param width The width, in pixels, of the image associated with this Display.
	 * \param height The height, in pixels, of the image associated with this Display.
	 * \param colour The initial colour of the image.
