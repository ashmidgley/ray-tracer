/** 
 * \brief Simple parser for Scene description files.
 * 
 * This class implements a simple parser for Scene description files.
 * A SceneReader is linked to a Scene object, and can then read one or more
 * text files describing Scene properties, Cameras, LightSources, and Objects.
 * These files are defined in blocks, and are case-insensitive. 
 * Whitespace is contracted, so new lines, spaces, and tabs are all just token separators.
 * Comments are introduced with \c #, and continue to the end of the line.
 *
 * There are five main types of block:
 * - Scene blocks
 * - Camera blocks
 * - Light blocks
 * - Material blocks
 * - Object blocks
 * Each block begins with a keyword (the type of block) and ends with the token 'End'
 * Details of each block type are given below.
 *
 * <b>Scene Blocks</b>
 *
 * Example:
\verbatim
 Scene
   ambientLight 0.2 0.2 0.2
   renderSize 800 600
   backgroundColour 0.5 0.5 0.5
   filename output.png
   rayDepth 5
 End
 \endverbatim
 *
 * Allowed elements within a Scene block are:
 * - <tt>ambientLight [red] [green] [blue]</tt>: Set the Scene's \c ambientLight property to the given Colour.
 * - <tt>renderSize [width] [height]</tt>: Set the Scene's \c renderWidth and \c renderHeight properties to the given values.
 * - <tt>backgroundColour [red] [green] [blue]</tt>: Set the Scene's \c backgroundColour property to the given Colour.
 * - <tt>filename [file]</tt>: Set the Scene's \c filename property to the given value.
 * - <tt>rayDepth [number]</tt>: Set the Scene's \c rayDepth property to the given value.
 *
 * <b>Camera Blocks</b>
 *
 * Example:
\verbatim
Camera PinholeCamera 1.5
  Rotate X -15
  Translate 0 -8 -15
End
\endverbatim
 *
 * A Camera block starts with a line giving the type of Camera and a parameter for that Camera if one can be provided.
 * In the example, a PinholeCamera is created with a focalLength of 1.5
 * Allowed elements within a Scene block are:
 * - <tt>Rotate [axis] [angle]</tt>: Apply a rotation of angle degrees about the specified axis (one of X, Y, or Z) to the Camera.
 * - <tt>Translate [x] [y] [z]</tt>: Apply the specified translation to the Camera.
 * - <tt>Scale [s]</tt>: Apply a uniform scaling by the given value to the Camera.
 * - <tt>Scale3 [sx] [sy] [sz]</tt>: Apply different scaling factors along the three axes to the Camera.
 *
 * <b>Light Blocks</b>
 *
 * Examples:
\verbatim
Light PointLight
  Location 1 2 3
  Colour 20 30 40
End

Light SpotLight 0 1 0 15
  Location 0 -5 0
  Colour 10 10 10
End
\endverbatim
 *
 * A Light block starts with a line giving the type of Light.
 * If the type of Light is SpotLight this is followed by four numbers.
 * The first three give the direction of the SpotLight, and the last one an angle in degrees.
 *
 * Allowed elements within a Light block are:
 * - <tt>Location [x] [y] [z]</tt>: Set the Light's \c location property to the given co-ordinates.
 * - <tt>Colour [red] [green] [blue]</tt>: Set the Light's \c colour property to the given Colour.
 *
 * <b> Material Blocks </b>
 *
 * Example:
 *
\verbatim
Material Gold
  Colour 1 0.88 0.25
  Specular 1 1 1 100
  Mirror 1 0.88 0.25
End
\endverbatim
 *
 * A Material block starts with a line giving the name of a Material (in this example, 'Gold').
 * Allowed elements within a Material block are:
 * - <tt>Ambient [red] [green] [blue]</tt>: Set the Material's \c ambientColour property to the given Colour.
 * - <tt>Diffuse [red] [green] [blue]</tt>: Set the Material's \c diffuseColour property to the given Colour.
 * - <tt>Colour [red] [green] [blue]</tt>: Set the Material's \c ambientColour and \c diffuseColour properties to the given Colour.
 * - <tt>Specular [red] [green] [blue] [exponent]</tt>: Set the Material's \c specularColour property to the given Colour, and its \c specularExponent to the given value.
 * - <tt>Mirror [red] [green] [blue]</tt>: Set the Material's \c diffuseColour property to the given Colour.
 *
 * <b> Object Blocks </b>
 *
 * Example:
\verbatim
Object Sphere
  Material Gold
  Specular 0.7 0.7 0.7 75 
  Scale3 1 2 3
  Rotate Y 45
  Translate 0 0 3
\endverbatim
 *
 * An Object block starts with a line giving the type of Object to
 * create (a sphere in this case - CSG Objects have some additional
 * description, below).
 *
 * Allowed elements within an Object block are:
 * - <tt>Rotate [axis] [angle]</tt>: Apply a rotation of angle degrees about the specified axis (one of X, Y, or Z) to the Object.
 * - <tt>Translate [x] [y] [z]</tt>: Apply the specified translation to the Object.
 * - <tt>Scale [s]</tt>: Apply a uniform scaling by the given value to the Object.
 * - <tt>Scale3 [sx] [sy] [sz]</tt>: Apply different scaling factors along the three axes to the Object.
 * - <tt>Material [name]</tt>: Copy the properties of a previously defined Material to the Object.
 * - <tt>Ambient [red] [green] [blue]</tt>: Set the \c ambientColour property of the Object's Material to the given Colour.
 * - <tt>Diffuse [red] [green] [blue]</tt>: Set the \c diffuseColour property of the Object's Material to the given Colour.
 * - <tt>Colour [red] [green] [blue]</tt>: Set the \c ambientColour and \c diffuseColour properties of the Object's Material to the given Colour.
 * - <tt>Specular [red] [green] [blue] [exponent]</tt>: Set the\c specularColour property to the given Colour, and its \c specularExponent to the given value.
 * - <tt>Mirror [red] [green] [blue]</tt>: Set the \c diffuseColour property of the Object's Material to the given Colour.
 *
 * <b> Object CSG blocks </b>
 * 
 * Example:
\verbatim
Object CSG intersection
  Object Sphere
    Colour 1 0 1
    Specular 1 1 1 100
    translate 0.45 0 0
  End
  Object Sphere
    Colour 0 1 0
    Specular 1 1 1 100
    translate -0.45 0 0
  End
End
\endverbatim
 *
 * "Object CSG" must be followed by a parameter that sets the type of
 * CSG node to create (e.g., the above example is an "intersection").
 *
 * You are required to place at the beginning of the inside of the
 * Object CSG block, two consecutive Object blocks (both are Sphere
 * objects in the example above). These are used to create the left
 * and the right child of the CSG node.
 *
 * Note that since the inner Object blocks are recursively parsed, it
 * is possible to include Object CSG nodes as the children of an
 * Object CSG node.
